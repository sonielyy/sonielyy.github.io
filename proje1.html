        <h2>License Plate Detection Program</h2>
        <p>This project demonstrates how to implement a license plate recognition system using the YOLOv8 object detection model. The goal is to detect Turkish vehicle plates by training a machine learning model with annotated images.</p>

      <h3>Why did you do this project?</h3>
      <p>Object detection in images is one of the most impactful applications of AI. I wanted to understand how cutting-edge models like YOLOv8 can be practically used, and vehicle license plate detection is a meaningful and challenging real-world problem.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>What was your contribution to this project?</h3>
      <p>I handled the entire pipeline including dataset collection, image annotation with CVAT, setting up the training environment, training the YOLOv8 model, and evaluating its performance on test images. I also created Python scripts for both training and testing phases.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>What was the most challenging part, and how did you overcome it?</h3>
      <p>The annotation process was time-consuming and required precision. Another challenge was configuring the training environment (Python, PyTorch, CUDA), which I solved by using virtual environments and online documentation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>What skills did you gain from this project and what future projects will it help you with?</h3>
      <p>This project strengthened my skills in computer vision, data preprocessing, and using deep learning frameworks like Ultralytics YOLO. It has prepared me for more advanced tasks such as real-time video object tracking, OCR integration, and custom object training for industrial applications.</p>
