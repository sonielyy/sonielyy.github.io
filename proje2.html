        <h2>SHEIN Product Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>This project focuses on scraping product data from the SHEIN website and analyzing it using Python and Power BI. The objective was to extract product features such as name, price, discount rate, reviews, and type ‚Äî and transform this raw data into meaningful insights for e-commerce analytics.</p>

      <h3>Why did you do this project?</h3>
      <p>E-commerce analytics is a rapidly growing field. I wanted to learn how to gather real-time data from the web and turn it into useful dashboards. SHEIN provided a great case study due to its diverse product range and frequent pricing dynamics.</p>

      <h3>What was your contribution to this project?</h3>
      <p>I developed a Python script using Selenium to scrape over 100 products from SHEIN‚Äôs online store, cleaned and transformed the data using Pandas, and exported the final dataset in Excel format. Then, I imported the data into Power BI and designed visual dashboards to explore patterns in pricing, product types, popularity, and discount rates.</p>

      <h3>What was the most challenging part, and how did you overcome it?</h3>
      <p>The main challenge was dealing with Captchas and dynamic web elements while scraping. I used appropriate delays and robust element locators to bypass these issues. Also, cleaning inconsistent pricing and textual data required custom Python functions and careful validation.</p>

      <h3>What skills did you gain from this project and what future projects will it help you with?</h3>
      <p>This project improved my skills in web scraping, data cleaning, and interactive dashboard creation. It has prepared me for projects involving competitive pricing analysis, customer behavior tracking, and marketplace data aggregation in retail analytics.</p>
