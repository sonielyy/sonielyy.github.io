        <h2>Hub-Uni: Beyond Academic Rankings</h2>
        <p>This project introduces a comprehensive university selection assistant platform that helps prospective students evaluate universities not only from an academic standpoint, but also based on social and logistical factors. It begins with data collected from 147 universities in 30 major cities across Turkey.</p>

      <h3>Why did you do this project?</h3>
      <p>Existing university recommendation tools focus mainly on academic performance, ignoring vital factors like accommodation, transportation, and social opportunities. We identified this gap and aimed to create a more holistic decision-making tool for students making one of the most important choices of their lives.</p>

      <h3>What was your contribution to this project?</h3>
      <p>I worked closely with my team on both the design and development of the platform. My responsibilities included data sourcing, integrating metrics such as nearby housing prices, dorm availability, and density of social venues like cafes and restaurants. I also contributed to the frontend interface that displays these insights to users in a digestible format.</p>

      <h3>What was the most challenging part, and how did you overcome it?</h3>
      <p>One of the main challenges was deciding which metrics were truly valuable for students and finding reliable data sources for them. During our graduation project poster presentation, we received constructive feedback especially about refining our metrics and considering alternative monetization strategies. These insights helped us reshape certain aspects of the platform.</p>

      <h3>What skills did you gain from this project and what future projects will it help you with?</h3>
      <p>This project enhanced my skills in user-centric design, data integration, and team collaboration. It laid the groundwork for future projects in educational technology, data-driven platforms, and public service tools. The feedback-driven development cycle also prepared me for iterative design in product-based work.</p>
