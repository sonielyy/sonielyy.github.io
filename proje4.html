        <h2>Predicting the 2023‚Äì2024 NBA All-Stars Using Data Science</h2>
        <p>This project aimed to forecast NBA All-Star players for the 2023‚Äì2024 season based on performance metrics such as points, assists, rebounds, and minutes played. Using R and clustering techniques, we analyzed the connection between player statistics and public perception through fan voting.</p>

      <h3>Why did you do this project?</h3>
      <p>The NBA All-Star selection process combines statistical performance and fan engagement. We wanted to bridge these two worlds with data science ‚Äî to see whether a model trained on real player data could mirror the results of one of basketball‚Äôs most anticipated events.</p>

      <h3>What was your contribution to this project?</h3>
      <p>I contributed to writing the R scripts for data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and clustering. I worked on identifying patterns across player positions and built the visualizations that highlighted which players had the strongest All-Star potential. I also implemented filtering logic to exclude underrepresented players with low playtime.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>What was the most challenging part, and how did you overcome it?</h3>
      <p>Determining the right clustering strategy and number of clusters was a major challenge. We used both the Elbow method and Hierarchical clustering to validate our model. Another challenge was eliminating bias from incomplete data ‚Äî we handled this with robust NA treatments and logical filters based on playtime statistics.</p>

      <h3>What skills did you gain from this project and what future projects will it help you with?</h3>
      <p>This project improved my statistical modeling and data visualization skills in R. It also deepened my understanding of clustering algorithms and sports analytics. I feel better equipped for predictive modeling tasks and future sports-related projects, particularly where performance forecasting is needed.</p>
