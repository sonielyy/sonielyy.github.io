        <h2>HERA: Musical Instruments Online Store</h2>
        <p>This project is a frontend website designed for selling musical instruments. It includes a modern, responsive layout with clean UI elements and a focus on user experience for browsing and shopping for instruments like guitars, pianos, and violins.</p>

      <h3>Why did you do this project?</h3>
      <p>I wanted to practice designing clean and responsive UIs using only HTML and CSS. E-commerce websites are great for testing real-world layout skills and UX logic, so I built a music-themed platform that simulates a shopping experience.</p>

      <h3>What was your contribution to this project?</h3>
      <p>I built the entire layout from scratch ‚Äî including the homepage, product grid, header navigation, and footer. I used grid and flexbox techniques for responsive design and ensured consistent spacing, color schemes, and font choices.</p>

      <p>This project improved my responsive web design and layout structuring skills. It also helped me become more efficient with CSS styling and component reuse, which are essential for more advanced frontend frameworks like React in the future.</p>
