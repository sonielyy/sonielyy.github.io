        <h2>ATP 2024 Match Outcome Prediction</h2>
        <p>This project uses ATP 2024 tennis match statistics to predict the winner of a match using a Random Forest Classifier. The pipeline includes data cleaning, transformation, augmentation, and model training with performance evaluation.</p>

      <h3>Why did you do this project?</h3>
      <p>I undertook this project to apply machine learning techniques to a real-world sports dataset and explore predictive modeling in the context of professional tennis. Tennis match outcomes are influenced by many nuanced statistics, and I was curious to see how accurately a Random Forest model could predict match results based on those features. This project also aligned with my interest in both data science and tennis, making it a compelling learning opportunity.</p>

      <h3>What was your contribution to this project?</h3>
      <p>I was responsible for the entire pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building. Specifically, I cleaned and transformed the ATP match dataset, implemented the data augmentation strategy to mitigate positional bias (swapping p1 and p2), trained the Random Forest classifier, and evaluated its performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. I also generated feature importance plots to interpret the model’s decisions.</p>

      <h3>What skills did you gain from this project and what future projects will it help you with?</h3>
      <p>This project sharpened my skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, and classification modeling using scikit-learn. I gained practical experience in handling real-world datasets with imperfections, working with imbalanced classes, and interpreting model outputs. These skills are transferable to future projects involving sports analytics, predictive modeling, or any domain where outcome prediction based on historical data is valuable — such as healthcare diagnostics or financial forecasting.</p>
